Its properties are assumed to be constant over time. A point within the plot may be used as center for relative coordinates, which are required to be Cartesian. Plots may have no explicit bounds, and may refer to an area of inference. A plot may be related to other plots in order to express parent-child, contiguity, or other type of links."

It is a container for measurements made on the organism (e.g. diameter, height, crown dimensions, biomass, growth form, number of stems). An individualOrganismObservation contains a reference to a unique plotObservation and to an individualOrganism. Optionally, the individualOrganismObservation may also link to a stratumObservation. "

It contains an AggregateValue, which is an assessment of the overall occurrence of an organism in a Plot (e.g. number of stems, percentage cover, total biomass, basal area). An AggregateOrganismObservation contains a link to a taxonOccurrence, where all the taxon identification information is contained. It also contains a reference to a single PlotObservation. Most of the remaining contextual information concerning the observation (like date-time period, observer, methods, protocol, projects _) is specified in the related PlotObservation. Optionally, the AggregateOrganismObservation may link to a StratumObservation. Additional grouping criteria may be specified through the reference to one or more ObservationGroupings.
