# Indicating the meaning of your headers and your units

Here, we want to know in what column some key information is stored.

 1. **If...**

     - **A. ... your data follows one of our pre-loaded standards:** You can select it to help filing out some of the general information. But you should double check that accurately describe your particular data set.
     - **B. ... you have already gone through this step and saved your profile (.rds file):** You can upload your profile. Double check that the information is filled out properly.
     - **C. ...This is your first time on this page:** You have to go through all the drop-down menus:
       - column 1: Go through this column before indicating more information in column 2. For each element, select the name of the field of your data, if any, that corresponds the best to what is asked. Leave "none" if none of your variable apply.
       - column 2: Complete the information of that column after you are done with the information of column 1, because some field may appear/disappear depending on what you entered in 1.
       - Once you are done, save your profile (a .rds file) so you won't need to go through all of this again (see B. above) 
       
 2. **click on 'APPLY CHANGES'** and read any warnings that may popup, adjust your entries if possible (it is okay to ignore warnings) and re-apply your changes. Save (or update if needed) your profile (.rds file)

 3. Check that your new formatted data looks ok. The headers and units are now following ATFS's standard. You can see what those are by clicking the little `r fa(name = "info-circle")` button.
 
 5. **click on 'NEXT'**
