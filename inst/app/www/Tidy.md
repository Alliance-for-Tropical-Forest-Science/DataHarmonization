# Tidying your table

At this stage, we want to make sure your data has **one row per observation and one variable per column.**

If you collected the same type of information in several columns (e.g. you added a column each time you visited a tree, or for each stem of the tree etc...), you need to "tidy" your table (also called wide-to-long reshaping). 

 1. In the top-most box, use the radio-buttons to indicate the reason you added new columns for a new observation.
 
 2. The next set of boxes are pre-filled with our best guesses at the columns that may contain the same variable (columns that have similar names like `dbh1`, `dbh2`, or  `year1`, `year2`...). Our guess may be terrible. Your role is to:
 
      a. Indicate the name of the new column that you which your variable to be called (e.g. `dbh`) in the text box. Note that this should start by a letter and have no space.
       
      b. Select all the columns of your data that represent the variable indicated in step a. (e.g `dbh1` and `dbh2`) using the drop-down menu.

      c. Tick the little tick-box on the upper-left corner of the box, to indicated that you do want to take into account what you selected.
       
 3. Repeat a-c for the next variable(s), e.g. you may need a box to indicate `year` in the text box and `year1` and `year2` in the drop-down menu. Don't forget to tick the tick-box for those variables too.
