# Defining your codes

This stage is only required if you indicated column(s) for tree codes in the Tree Measurement section of the previous tab.

The table shows the list of codes that are available in the column(s) you indicated.
If you intend to translate these codes to match the ones of another profile (which you will be able to do at a later step), or vice-versa, you need to fill this table out.

Once you are done with the table you can update your profile (by downloading and overwriting your .rds file). If you have already saved your profile after this step and used it to fill out the previous step, you can click on the "Use your profile" button to automatically fill the table.


#### Fill-out the `Definition` by selecting a pre-written denfinition or enter your own.
