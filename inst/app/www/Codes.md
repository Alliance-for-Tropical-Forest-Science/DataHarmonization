# Defining your tree codes

This stage is only required if you indicated column(s) for tree codes (in the Tree Measurement in the headers tab).

This table shows the list  of codes that are available in the column(s) you indicated. 
If you intend to translate these codes to match the ones of another profile (which you will be able to do at a later step), or vice-versa, you need to fill this table out.

You can select a pre-loaded definition or enter your own. 

Once you are done with that table you can update your profile (by downloading and overwriting your .rds file).

If you have already saved you profile after this step and used it profile to fill out the previous step, you can click on the "Use your profile" button to automatically fill the table.
