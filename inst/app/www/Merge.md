You will need to do that if, e.g., your species or your plot information is stored in a different table than your inventory data.
 
 1. In **Merge this table**, select the main measurement table (the one onto which you want to merge extra information from other tables).
 
 2. In **And this table**, Select the table that you want to bring info from.
 
 3. <span style="color:#00c0ef;">click on both blue arrows.</span>
 
 4. In the two dropdown menus about the 'KEY column(s)', select the column(s) that allow to connect the to tables together.**Select all columns that are common between tables, otherwise columns will be repeated in the output, with extension '.y' in the name of the second table.**
 
 5. **click on 'Merge tables'.**
 
 6. If you are still not down to one table, another box will appear. repeat 1-5 in next box
