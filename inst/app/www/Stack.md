# Stacking tables

You can stack multiple tables on top of each other, if they have the **same set of columns**, **with exact same names**.

You need to do that if multiple tables represent same measurements made on different sets of trees (e.g. at different plots), or different censuses.


 1. Select the tables that have the same set of columns and can be stacked on top of each other
 
 2. **Click on 'STACK TABLES'.**
 
 3. **Click on 'GO TO MERGE'** (note that the label of that button will be changed to 'SKIP MERGING SINCE ALL YOUR DATA IS NOW STACKED', if you are already down to noe table.)
