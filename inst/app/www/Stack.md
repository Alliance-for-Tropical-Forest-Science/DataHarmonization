# Stacking tables

You can stack multiple tables on top of each other, if they have the **same set of columns**, **with exact same names**.

You need to do that if multiple tables represent same measurements made on different sets of trees (e.g. at different plots), or different censuses.

In this example, we uploaded four tables. Three of them are individual census tables, with the same set of columns (Tables `Census1`, `Census2`, and `Census3`. 

To stack our three tables, we select each of them and click `Stack Tables`. The new `unified` table appears at the bottom of the page.")

(The fourth table, `SpeciesTable`, is different, and we will merge its information at the next step.)
