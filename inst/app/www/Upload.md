# Uploading your files

This is an example where we upload two tables, one for tree data and one for plot data.

You need to indicate what is your unit of measurement (plot, species, tree or stem). Here we have tree level data.

Tables have to be .CSV files. 

If your data does not look good when it appears on the right panel, you can click on the little gear icon to specify the the field separator character and whether the file contains the names of the variables as its first line.

You can give your tables a name so they are easily recognizable in the next steps.
