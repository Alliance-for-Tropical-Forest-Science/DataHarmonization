#### The output profile you selected has a table of codes that you may want to match with your codes. 

#### We tried to help you out by already matching the codes with the same definitions, but you need to double check and fill out the rest of the codes


## Help 
**Row names:** These are your codes. They may come from multiple columns so they are grouped under a blank row indicating what column they are coming from, in bold . _**Tip: You can collapse the groups by clicking on those blank rows**_.

**Column names:** These are the codes in the output profile you selected. They may come from multiple columns so they are grouped by color and the name of those column(s) are given at the top of the table, in bold (and also in the Output columns legend below the main table). _**Tip: Hover over the codes in the column names to see the definitions.**_

**What to do:**

 1. For each of your codes, select the radio button in the column that corresponds most to your definition. We already selected the buttons for codes that match definitions perfectly. _Tip: Hover over the codes in the column names to see the definitions._
 
 2. If there is no match, leave blank.
 
 3. **Click on 'SEE DEFINITIONS/UPDATE'** to double check your work. Edit the table as needed and repeat this step until satisified.
 
 4. When you are satisfied, click on the **'Apply Code Translation'** button. You will see columns added to your table. They will have the column names that the output profile expects and will be filled with the output profile's codes, based on the codes in your column(s) and the mapping you indicated.
