# Applying corrections

If you select "Yes" to any of these corrections, you will be able to change the default parameters.

These functions will add new columns to your data (indicated with `_DataHarmonizationCor` suffix) and won't alter your original columns.

Note that some of these function are quite slow and it can take a few minutes for the output to show up.

**You may want to use the app in two folds: first without applying corrections, to get your data in the intended format, second to apply correction on the "master" dataset (after you've merge your data with your collaborator's data.)**
