# Applying corrections

Here you can apply some corrections to your data. 

These functions will add new columns to your data (indicated with `_DataHarmonizationCor` suffix) and won't alter your original columns.

When you select "Yes" to any of the correction functions, you are able to change the default parameters.


Note that some of these functions are quite slow and it can take a few minutes for the output to show up.

**In the case of collaboration, you may want to use the app in two folds: first without applying corrections, to get all datasets in same format and merge them, second to apply correction on the "master" dataset.**
