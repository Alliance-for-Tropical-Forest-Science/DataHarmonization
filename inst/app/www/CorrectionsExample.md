# Applying corrections

Here you can detect errors and/or apply all corrections.

When you select "Yes" to any of these, you will be able to change the default parameters.

These functions will add new columns to your data (indicated with `_DataHarmonizationCor` suffix) and won't alter your original columns.

Note that some of these function are quite slow and it can take a few minutes for the output to show up.

####  In the case of collaboration, you may want to use the app in two folds: first without applying corrections, to get all datasets in same format and merge them, second to apply correction on the "master" dataset.
